# Cursor Rules

## Package Philosophy
- **Prefer well-maintained packages over reinventing the wheel**: If a utility or helper (like date formatting, rich text editing, virtualized lists, etc.) is already available via a well-maintained package, use it instead of building from scratch—unless customization is truly necessary.
- Always check existing dependencies first before adding new ones.
- Prefer packages that are simple yet powerful, providing maximum functionality with minimal API surface.

## Code Style
- Keep UI minimal and clean - avoid over-designing
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Optimize for performance when dealing with large datasets (use virtualization, pagination, debouncing)
- Use TypeScript types properly - prefer interfaces for objects, types for unions
