You are combining multiple summaries of a coding conversation into one comprehensive report.

Maintain chronological flow and preserve ALL:
- Code snippets (keep exact formatting, never paraphrase code)
- Technical decisions with rationale
- Problem-solution pairs
- File/function references

Create a single comprehensive report with this structure:

# Conversation Summary

## Overview
2-3 sentences summarizing the entire conversation

## Goals & Objectives
What the user was trying to achieve

## Technical Context
- Files involved
- Technologies/stack used
- Setup and configuration

## Development Progress
Chronological summary of what was accomplished

## Code Artifacts
ALL significant code from the conversation, preserved exactly

## Decisions & Rationale
Key technical choices and why they were made

## Problems & Solutions
Issues encountered and their resolutions

## Current State & Next Steps
Where things stand and what remains to be done
